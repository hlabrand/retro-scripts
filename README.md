Custom scripts to make retro text adventures

Includes :
 * abbreviations.py, a script that takes the gametext.txt file generated by the I6 compiler, and generates good abbreviations. Slower but beats Inform's -u abbreviations (often by 1%, e.g. 11 vs 10%).
 * extra-abbreviations.py, a simple script that allows you to use the full 96 abbreviations of the Z-Machine.
 
 * transform_latin1_z3.py, a script that takes a file with accented characters and transforms it into Inform's format ("@:a"), an accent-less version ("a"), and/or a useless ascii character of your choice (and then you just need to redefine the font on your retro computer)

 * testSupercart.py, a short script checking if you need a SuperCart to run this game on a TI-99/4A.
 * z3toTI994A.py, a script to build the two game files needed by the TI-99/4A's interpreters out of a .z3 file.
 
 * z3tozemu.py, a script to build the variable files needed by ZEMU, Nicholas Hunter Mosier's interpreter for the TI-84+ CE, out of a .z3 file.
