# retro-scripts
Custom scripts to make retro text adventures

Includes :
 * atariio.c, a patch to JZIP 2.1's atariio.c to include proper accented letters display (when possible) on the Atari ST.
 * atari.mak, a corrected makefile
 * the termcap-tos folder, which contains the termcap (terminal capabilities) library for TOS.
(Copy all 6 files above into JZIP 2.1's source distribution, overwriting if needed, in order to build JZIP for the Atari ST. You will need m68k-atari-mint-gcc from Vincent Rivi√®re's page.)

 * abbreviations.py, a script that takes the gametext.txt file generated by the I6 compiler, and generates good abbreviations. Slower but beats Inform's -u abbreviations (often by 1%, e.g. 11 vs 10%), but still not optimal.

 * testSupercart.py, a short script checking if you need a SuperCart to run this game on a TI-99/4A.
 * z3toTI994A.py, a script to build the two game files needed by the TI-99/4A's interpreters out of a .z3 file.
 
 * z3tozemu.py, a script to build the variable files needed by ZEMU, Nicholas Hunter Mosier's interpreter for the TI-84+ CE, out of a .z3 file.
